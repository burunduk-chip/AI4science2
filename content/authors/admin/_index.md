## About Me

I am an interdisciplinary researcher with background in physics, applied mathematics and machine learning. 
Currently I am applying machine learning to photonics at Hamburg University of Technology. I am also interested in connecting mathematics 
and physics using pure human intelligence :) 
My first papers ...
